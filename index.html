        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Chief DesignerüñºÔ∏è</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Siwei Su, and I‚Äôm a photographer and filmmaker currently studying Pre-law Philosophy at the University of California, Riverside. While my academic focus is grounded in critical thinking and ethics, my creative identity has been shaped by a deep passion for photography and visual storytelling. This passion took root during my high school years at Huamei Bond International School, where I served as the school‚Äôs official photographer from 2019 to 2024. Those five years taught me more than just how to operate a camera‚Äîthey taught me how to frame emotions, capture fleeting moments, and tell stories without words. Photography helped me see the world differently. Whether it was capturing school events, portraits, or candid moments of campus life, I learned how powerful a single image could be in evoking memory, connection, and meaning. My dedication to the craft led to one of my proudest accomplishments: being awarded the "Best Photo of 2023‚Äì2025" at my school. That recognition affirmed my commitment to growing as a visual artist and deepened my desire to explore photography on a more serious and professional level.<br><br>

        What distinguishes me as a photographer is not just passion, but a technical and creative investment in the craft. I‚Äôm a signed photographer on <a href="https://500px.com" target="_blank">500px</a>, a platform known for its high standards and global community of professionals. Joining 500px validated my ability to consistently deliver work that meets industry-level expectations, and it‚Äôs where I continue to share some of my best shots. I work primarily with three powerful Sony camera bodies: the A7 IV, the FX30, and the A6400. My lens kit includes the 24-70mm GM2, the 70-200mm GM, and the G Master 35mm‚Äîgear that gives me the flexibility to shoot everything from dynamic street photography to intimate portraits and cinematic short films. My work isn‚Äôt limited to still photography, either. I‚Äôve written, directed, and filmed three short films, each a personal exploration of visual narrative and emotion. These films‚Äî<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIZMKlOMyD4" target="_blank">Film 1</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6XBZKau4rQ&t=10s" target="_blank">Film 2</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZKuxMIzFNs&t=238s" target="_blank">Film 3</a>‚Äîrepresent different facets of my artistic voice and experiment with framing, lighting, and pacing in unique ways. I handle all aspects of production myself, from pre-visualization and shooting to editing and sound design.<br><br>

         At the heart of my photography is a commitment to storytelling and truth. Whether I‚Äôm shooting on campus, on a mountain trail, or on set for a short film, my goal is always to create something that resonates‚Äîsomething that captures emotion and human experience with honesty. I believe photography is more than a skill; it‚Äôs a way of seeing the world and connecting with others. As someone who also plans to enter law enforcement after graduation, I see powerful links between the two worlds: both require attention to detail, strong observational skills, and a commitment to integrity. My photography allows me to document life, highlight underrepresented perspectives, and challenge myself creatively, while my future in public service offers a path to making a real impact. I‚Äôm always looking for new ways to push my boundaries, whether that‚Äôs experimenting with color grading, shooting in difficult lighting, or capturing real stories through documentary work. My dream is to someday combine my dual passions for service and storytelling by working on public awareness campaigns or documentary projects that shed light on social issues. Photography isn‚Äôt just a hobby‚Äîit‚Äôs part of who I am, and it continues to shape how I move through the world, both as an artist and as a future leader.
